I really enjoyed doing this project as it felt like “real” coding to me. It felt like something I would be doing out in the field, which was refreshing. However, I did not like Pygame, as I found the error messages to be confusing and vague and more trouble than it should have been. I also had a lot of trouble running the game on my terminal. It seemed like every time I started the game a new issue arose which was very confusing. My main responsibility was menus.py. I enjoyed this part a lot because I felt like I had a lot of control over the GUI and just graphics and aesthetic overall. Once I figured out how to code the welcome screen to pop up, everything started flowing easier. I would give myself an A because I tried my best and put my best foot forward. Overall, I really enjoyed working with Vahan and Kenny and felt like the final product was very well done.
